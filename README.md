Final Year Project
Discord Chatbot

You may need to install:
python = ">=3.8.0,<3.9"
numpy = "^1.22.2"
discord = "^1.7.3"
keras = "^2.8.0"
tensorflow = "^2.8.0"
more-itertools = "^8.12.0"
nest-asyncio = "^1.5.5"

e.g pip install discord

Attached are python files coded with VSCode and a ipynb file used on Google Colab.

The bot should already be online if you join the server so you can instantly start chatting with it.

If this isn't the case then you can either run it using a notebook with the ipynb file or VSCode using the python files by typing "python main.py"

It is constantly active using Replit:
